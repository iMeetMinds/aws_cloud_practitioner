## **1. Overview of AWS Compute Services**

AWS offers multiple compute services beyond EC2, catering to containerized workloads, serverless computing, batch processing, and simplified hosting solutions.

## **2. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

- **Fully managed container orchestration service** for Docker containers.
- Supports **Fargate (serverless)** and **EC2 (self-managed) launch types**.
- Uses **task definitions** to define container configurations.
- **Cluster management**: Deploy and scale containers across AWS infrastructure.
- Integrates with **Elastic Load Balancing, IAM, CloudWatch, and AWS Secrets Manager**.

### **ECS vs. EKS vs. Fargate**

|Service|Description|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**ECS**|AWS-managed container orchestration|Deploying Docker containers|
|**EKS**|Kubernetes-managed orchestration|Kubernetes workloads|
|**Fargate**|Serverless container execution|No infrastructure management|

## **3. AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)**

- **Event-driven, serverless compute service** that runs code without managing servers.
- Supports **multiple programming languages** (Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.).
- **Triggers**: S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch Events.
- **Pricing**: Pay only for execution time (invocations + duration + memory used).
- **Cold Starts**: Initial execution delay for infrequently used functions.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time file processing, IoT applications, event-driven applications.

## **4. AWS Batch**

- **Fully managed batch computing service** for running jobs in parallel.
- Dynamically provisions **compute resources based on workload needs**.
- Supports **EC2 and Fargate** for job execution.
- Commonly used for **scientific computing, financial modeling, and simulations**.
- Jobs are defined as **AWS Batch job definitions** and executed via job queues.

## **5. AWS Lightsail**

- **Simplified cloud computing** service for web applications, blogs, and small workloads.
- Provides **pre-configured virtual private servers (VPS)** with **fixed pricing**.
- Includes **built-in networking, storage, and security options**.
- Supports easy deployment of **WordPress, LAMP, Node.js, and more**.
- **Best for small businesses, startups, and developers needing quick deployment**.

## **6. Exam Tips**

- Know the difference between **ECS, EKS, and Fargate**.
- Understand **Lambda triggers, pricing model, and cold starts**.
- Learn when to use **AWS Batch for parallel processing**.
- Be familiar with **Lightsail as an easy-to-use VPS service**.
