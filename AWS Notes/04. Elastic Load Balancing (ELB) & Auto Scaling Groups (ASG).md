## **1. Overview of ELB & ASG**

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand to maintain application performance and cost efficiency.

## **2. Types of Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**

|Load Balancer Type|Features|Best Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**|Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based & host-based routing|Web applications & microservices|
|**Network Load Balancer (NLB)**|Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), low latency, handles millions of requests/sec|High-performance & real-time applications|
|**Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**|Legacy option, supports basic Layer 4 & Layer 7 load balancing|Legacy applications (not recommended)|

## **3. Features of ELB**

- **Health Checks**: ELB monitors the health of EC2 instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
- **Sticky Sessions**: Ensures that a user session is consistently routed to the same instance.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Offloads SSL decryption from application servers.
- **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**: Spreads traffic evenly across instances in multiple Availability Zones.

## **4. Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**

### **a. Components of ASG**

- **Launch Template**: Defines instance type, AMI, security groups, etc.
- **Scaling Policies**: Determines when to add or remove instances.
- **Desired Capacity**: The number of instances to maintain.
- **Minimum & Maximum Capacity**: The lower and upper limits of instances in the group.

### **b. Scaling Policies**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Scaling Policy|Description|
|**Target Tracking**|Adjusts instances based on a metric like CPU utilization (e.g., keep CPU at 50%)|
|**Step Scaling**|Adds or removes instances in steps when thresholds are crossed|
|**Scheduled Scaling**|Adds or removes instances at predefined times|

## **5. ELB & ASG Integration**

- **ELB works with ASG** to distribute traffic efficiently while scaling instances dynamically.
- When an instance fails a health check, **ASG replaces it automatically**.
- ELB can distribute traffic **across multiple AZs**, ensuring high availability.
