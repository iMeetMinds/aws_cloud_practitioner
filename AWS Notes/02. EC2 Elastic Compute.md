**# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

## **1. Overview of EC2**

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It allows users to launch and manage virtual servers known as **instances**.

## **2. Key Features of EC2**

- **Scalability**: Easily scale instances up or down based on demand.
- **Pay-as-you-go Pricing**: Pay only for the resources you use.
- **Multiple Instance Types**: General-purpose, Compute-optimized, Memory-optimized, Storage-optimized.
- **Choice of Operating Systems**: Linux, Windows, MacOS.
- **Elastic IP Addresses**: Static IPs that can be reassigned to different instances.


## **3. EC2 Instance Lifecycle**

### **a. Launch**: Create an instance from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

### **b. Running**: Instance is active and serving requests.

### **c. Stopped**: Instance is powered off but retains data.

### **d. Terminated**: Instance is permanently deleted along with attached storage (unless configured otherwise).

## **4. EC2 Pricing Models**

- **On-Demand**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second. Best for short-term workloads.
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to a 1 or 3-year term for discounts.
- **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused AWS capacity at reduced prices (can be interrupted).
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing for long-term commitments.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical servers dedicated to a single customer.

## **5. EC2 Instance Types**

|Instance Type|Use Case|
|---|---|
|**t3, t4g**|General-purpose workloads|
|**c6i, c7g**|Compute-intensive applications|
|**r6g, x2idn**|Memory-intensive applications|
|**i4i, d3**|Storage-intensive applications|
|**g5, p4d**|GPU-based machine learning workloads|

## **6. Security in EC2**

- Use **Security Groups** to control inbound/outbound traffic.
- Enable **IAM roles** for EC2 to access AWS services securely.
- Implement **Key Pairs** for SSH authentication.
- Use **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** for secure access without SSH.

## **7. EC2 Auto Scaling**

- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**: Automatically scale EC2 instances up/down based on demand.
- **Scaling Policies**:
    - **Target Tracking**: Adjusts instances based on metrics like CPU utilization.
    - **Step Scaling**: Adds/removes instances in steps.
    - **Scheduled Scaling**: Adjusts instances at predefined times.

## **8. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- Types of Load Balancers:
    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
    - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Best for high-performance TCP/UDP traffic.
    - **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: Legacy load balancing option.

## **9. Exam Tips**

- Understand the different **EC2 pricing models** and when to use them.
- Learn the purpose of **security groups, key pairs, IAM roles**.
- Know the difference between **Auto Scaling, ELB, and EC2 instance types**.
- Be familiar with **Spot, Reserved, and On-Demand Instances**.
