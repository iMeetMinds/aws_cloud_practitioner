## **1. Introduction to AWS Security and Compliance**

AWS follows a **shared responsibility model**, meaning security is divided between AWS and the customer:

- **AWS is responsible for** securing the **infrastructure** (hardware, software, networking, and facilities).
- **Customers are responsible for** securing their **applications, data, and configurations**.

## **2. AWS Security Services**

### **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- Manages user access and permissions.
- Uses **policies, roles, and multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- **Best Practices:**
    - Follow **least privilege principle**.
    - Enable **MFA** for all IAM users.
    - Use **IAM roles** instead of static credentials.

### **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**

- Provides encryption keys for data security.
- Integrated with **S3, RDS, EBS, and Lambda**.
- **Use Case:** Encrypting sensitive customer data stored in AWS.

### **AWS Shield**

- **Managed DDoS protection** for AWS applications.
- **Shield Standard:** Automatic protection at no extra cost.
- **Shield Advanced:** Enhanced protection with monitoring and response.

### **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

- Protects applications from common attacks like **SQL injection and XSS**.
- Works with **ALB, API Gateway, and CloudFront**.
- **Use Case:** Filtering malicious traffic from public-facing applications.

### **Amazon GuardDuty**

- **Threat detection service** that analyzes AWS account activity.
- Detects **malicious IPs, unusual access, and compromised credentials**.
- **Use Case:** Continuous security monitoring without manual intervention.

### **AWS Security Hub**

- Centralized **security management dashboard**.
- Aggregates alerts from **GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer, and AWS Inspector**.
- **Use Case:** Compliance tracking and security automation.

### **AWS Inspector**

- **Automated security assessment** for EC2 instances.
- Scans for **vulnerabilities and unpatched software**.
- **Use Case:** Ensuring EC2 instances are secure before deployment.

### **AWS Secrets Manager**

- Securely stores **API keys, database credentials, and sensitive information**.
- **Use Case:** Eliminating hardcoded credentials in applications.

## **3. Compliance Frameworks and AWS Certifications**

AWS adheres to major compliance frameworks:

- **ISO 27001:** International security standard.
- **SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3:** Reports for security controls.
- **PCI DSS:** Compliance for handling credit card transactions.
- **HIPAA:** Security framework for healthcare data.
- **GDPR:** Data privacy compliance for European customers.

## **4. Data Protection and Encryption**

### **Encryption in Transit vs. Encryption at Rest**

- **Encryption in transit:** Protects data while moving between services (e.g., TLS/SSL for HTTPS traffic).
- **Encryption at rest:** Protects stored data using **AES-256 encryption** (e.g., S3, RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB encryption).

### **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**

- Manages SSL/TLS certificates for AWS resources.
- **Use Case:** Securing HTTPS connections for web applications.

## **5. Logging and Monitoring**

### **AWS CloudTrail**

- Records **API calls** and tracks changes to AWS resources
- **Use Case:** Auditing user activities for security and compliance.

### **Amazon CloudWatch**

- Monitors resource metrics and application logs.
- Includes **alarms, dashboards, and automated responses**.
- **Use Case:** Detecting abnormal activity based on system metrics.

### **AWS Config**

- Monitors **AWS resource configurations** and compliance status.
- **Use Case:** Ensuring AWS resources meet security policies.

## **6. AWS Well-Architected Framework - Security Pillar**

- **Identity & Access Management:** Implement least privilege.
- **Detection & Response:** Use **CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and AWS Security Hub**.
- **Infrastructure Protection:** Leverage **WAF, Shield, and Security Groups**.
- **Data Protection:** Use **KMS, encryption, and Secrets Manager**.
- **Incident Response:** Plan security events with **automated responses**.

## **7. Best Practices for AWS Security and Compliance**

- **Enable MFA** for all accounts.
- **Use IAM roles instead of static credentials.**
- **Enforce encryption** for data in transit and at rest.
- **Monitor AWS accounts** using **GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudTrail**.
- **Regularly audit AWS configurations** with **AWS Config**.

## **8. Exam Tips**

- Understand **shared responsibility model**.
- Learn **AWS security services** and their use cases.
- Know **encryption methods** and when to use **KMS vs. Secrets Manager**.
- Be familiar with **compliance frameworks** (SOC, PCI, HIPAA, GDPR).
- Recognize the difference between **CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Config**.
