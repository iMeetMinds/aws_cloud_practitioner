## **1. Overview of Infrastructure Management in AWS**

AWS provides various services and tools to **automate, manage, and scale infrastructure** efficiently. These services help reduce manual intervention, enhance security, and optimize resource utilization.

## **2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying applications** without managing infrastructure.
- Supports multiple environments: **Web applications, APIs, worker applications**.
- Automates **provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring**.
- Supports multiple languages: **Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, Ruby, Go, PHP**.
- Use Case: Quick deployment of web applications with minimal configuration.

## **3. AWS CloudFormation**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service** for automating AWS resource provisioning.
- Uses **YAML or JSON templates** to define and deploy AWS infrastructure.
- Enables **repeatable, version-controlled deployments**.
- **Drift Detection** helps identify changes in deployed resources.
- Use Case: Automating infrastructure deployment in a predictable manner.

## **4. AWS OpsWorks**

- **Configuration management service** supporting Chef and Puppet.
- Automates **server configuration, software installation, and patch management**.
- **OpsWorks Stacks**: Manages EC2 instances with predefined configurations.
- **OpsWorks for Chef/Puppet**: Fully managed Chef/Puppet master servers.
- Use Case: Automating server configuration and application deployments.

## **5. AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**

- **Centralized management tool** for EC2, on-premises, and hybrid cloud infrastructure.
- Key Features:
    - **Session Manager**: Secure shell (SSH) access without exposing instances to the internet.
    - **Patch Manager**: Automates OS and software patching.
    - **Parameter Store**: Securely stores configuration values and secrets.
    - **Automation**: Executes predefined operational tasks.
- Use Case: Managing large-scale cloud and hybrid environments efficiently.

## **6. AWS Auto Scaling**

- **Automatically scales EC2 instances and other AWS services** based on demand.
- **Scaling Policies:**
    - **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjusts capacity based on metrics.
    - **Scheduled Scaling**: Increases or decreases capacity at specific times.
- Works with **EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, Aurora, and Spot Fleets**
- Use Case: Handling traffic spikes and optimizing costs.

## **7. AWS CodeDeploy**

- **Automates software deployments** to EC2, on-premises servers, and Lambda.
- **Deployment Strategies:**
    - **In-place (Rolling) Deployment**: Updates existing instances gradually.
    - **Blue/Green Deployment**: Switches traffic between old and new environments.
    - **Canary Deployment**: Gradually shifts a percentage of traffic.
- **Monitors deployment health** and automatically rolls back on failure.
- Use Case: Continuous deployment for applications.

## **8. AWS CodePipeline**

- **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) service**.
- Automates **code builds, testing, and deployments**.
- Integrates with **AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy**.
- Use Case: Streamlining software release processes.

## **9. AWS Service Catalog**

- **Manages and deploys approved IT services at scale**.
- Ensures compliance with **security and governance policies**.
- Use Case: Standardized resource deployment for large organizations.

## **10. AWS CloudTrail & AWS Config**

- **CloudTrail**: Logs **all AWS API activity** for auditing and security monitoring.
- **AWS Config**: Tracks configuration changes in AWS resources.
- Use Case: **Compliance auditing and security analysis**.

## **11. Exam Tips**

- Understand the differences between **Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, and OpsWorks**.
- Know when to use **Auto Scaling vs. AWS Systems Manager**.
- Learn **deployment strategies (Rolling, Blue/Green, Canary)**.
- Be familiar with **CloudTrail for auditing and Config for compliance monitoring**.
- Understand how **CodePipeline automates CI/CD workflows**.
