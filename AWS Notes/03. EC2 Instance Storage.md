**# EC2 Instance Storage**

## **1. Overview of EC2 Storage**

Amazon EC2 provides multiple storage options to support different workloads. These storage types vary in performance, durability, and cost, allowing users to select the most suitable storage solution.

## **2. EC2 Storage Options**

EC2 instances support the following primary storage types:

- **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** – Persistent, block-level storage.
- **Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)** – Temporary, high-speed storage attached to EC2 instances.
- **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** – Managed file storage for Linux-based workloads.
- **Amazon FSx** – Managed file system services for Windows and Lustre.
- **Amazon S3** – Object storage for scalable data storage and backup.

## **3. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

### **a. Features**

- Persistent, durable, and highly available storage.
- Can be attached to a running EC2 instance.
- Supports snapshots and backups.
- Can be detached and reattached to different EC2 instances.

### **b. EBS Volume Types**

|Volume Type|Use Case|IOPS|Latency|
|---|---|---|---|
|**gp3**|General-purpose|Up to 16K|Low|
|**gp2**|General-purpose|Variable|Low|
|**io2/io1**|High-performance|Up to 256K|Ultra-low|
|**st1**|Throughput-optimized HDD|N/A|Moderate|
|**sc1**|Cold HDD|N/A|High|

### **c. Snapshots**

- **EBS snapshots** allow backups to be created.
- Stored in **Amazon S3** but are incremental (only changed data is saved).
- Snapshots can be used to **restore or create new volumes**.

## **4. Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)**

### **a. Features**

- Temporary storage directly attached to the EC2 instance.
- Data is **lost when the instance is stopped or terminated**.
- **High-speed, low-latency storage**.
- Best for temporary cache, scratch space, or buffer storage.

### **b. Instance Store vs EBS**

|Feature|Instance Store|Amazon EBS|
|---|---|---|
|Durability|Temporary|Persistent|
|Performance|Very High|High (depends on type)|
|Data Persistence|Lost on stop/terminate|Retained unless deleted|
|Backup|No backups|Supports snapshots|

## **5. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**

### **a. Features**

- Fully managed **file storage** for Linux workloads.
- Supports **multiple EC2 instances** accessing the same filesystem.
- Automatically scales as storage demand grows.
- **Use Case:** Shared storage for multiple EC2 instances, machine learning, big data analytics.

## **6. Amazon FSx**

- Managed file storage solution for Windows (FSx for Windows) and Lustre (FSx for Lustre).
- **FSx for Windows**: Supports SMB protocol, Active Directory integration.
- **FSx for Lustre**: High-performance storage for ML, HPC, and big data workloads.

## **7. Exam Tips**

- Know the difference between **EBS, Instance Store, EFS, FSx, and S3**.
- Understand **EBS volume types** and their use cases.
- Remember that **Instance Store is temporary** and data is lost on stop/terminate.
- Be familiar with **EBS snapshots and backups**.
- Understand when to use **EFS for shared storage** and **FSx for Windows/Lustre**.
